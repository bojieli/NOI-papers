<h1>1995 USACO Final Round</h1>
<h2> Day 1, June 1, 1995</h2>

<h3>Problem 1:  Cows on Parade</h3>
<pre>
Farmer John was marching 19 of his finest black Angus and white Jersey
cows to market the other day when his wife, Farmeress Joanne, noticed
that all 16 possible combinations of four successive black and white
cows (e.g., bbbb, bbbw, bbwb, bbww, ..., wwww) were present (as
contiguous cow-subsequences) as the parade passed by.  Of course, some
of the combinations overlapped others.

Part 1:  Print any ordering of 19 marching black and white cows that
contains all the possible four-color combinations.

Part 2:  Accept as console input the number of cows and the length of
the subsequence and print any ordering of the cows that contains all
the possible color combinations.  Typical lengths and subsequences
are:  2,5; 3,10; 4,19; 5,36 and more.  The number of cows will not
exceed 32,782 and the length of the subsequence will not exceed 15.  It
is guaranteed that a solution will exist.  Your program must run in
less than 30 seconds.
